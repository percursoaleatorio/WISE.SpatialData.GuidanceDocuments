Creating technical documentation
*******************************************

This chapter covers four topics:

* How to write the documentation using reStructuredText_ or Markdown_.
* How to generate the documentation in HTML format or PDF format using Sphinx_.
* How to maintain the documentation using version control (Git_ and GitHub_).
* How to publish the documentation using `GitHub Pages`_.

restructuredtext and Markdown
=============================

reStructuredText_ and Markdown_ are two popular lightweight markup languages.
They are both plain text formats, and can be edited with any text editor.

reStructuredText_ is the markup language used in this project,
and is the default markup language supported by Sphinx_.
Markdown_ is also supported by Sphinx_, but only the CommonMark_ flavour
(supported by GitHub_ and other platforms) is supported.::

      # This is a section in Markdown   This is a section in RST
                                       ========================

Sphinx
=====================

Sphinx_ is a document generator based on docutils_
(an open-source text processing system, 
for processing plain text documentation into useful formats, 
such as HTML, LaTeX, ODT or XML).

In Sphinx_, content (the text) is separated from presentation (formatting):

*  Content is stored in plain text files using a simple markup language 
   (reStructuredText_). 
   
*  Presentation is defined using themes and templates 
   for each type of output (HTML, LaTeX, PDF).
   
This separation allows the authors to focus on the content 
and not on the presentation or the output format(s).

Also, if the documentation needs to be localised to another language,
the text can be translated (using translation tools, if required),
and all the formatting is applied later 
(without requiring further changes to the localised documents).

The purpose of this section is
to provide 'quick' reference information
(on syntax, available tools, style conventions, etc)
that may be required by technical writers or translators
working with the project documentation.

The most important information is about reStructuredText_,
the markup language used in the technical documentation (user manual, etc.).

There is also some (basic) information about Sphinx_,
the application that automatically converts the text files
and generates the documentation in HTML format or PDF format.

For example, this HTML page was originally written in reStructuredText.

Press the *View page source* link (in the top right of the page) 
to see the original reStructuredText source code.
