Welcome to the WISE Documentation 
*********************************

Here you will find information about how to create and maintain the documentation for WISE dataflows and projects. 

We want to move away from the traditional "Guidance Documents" in PDF format.
Instead, we want to create living documentation that is easily accessible and can be updated regularly.
Also, we would rather never see a Word document with track changes again in our lives...

Follow the link to learn more about the `Docs as Code <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/>`_ approach.

The WISE Documentation is organized into three main sections:

* **Getting Started**: 

  This section provides instructions on how to set up the WISE environment and get started with the documentation.

* **Technical documentation**: 

  This section provides guidelines and best practices 
  for creating and maintaining technical documentation for WISE dataflows and projects. 
  It covers topics such as writing style, formatting, and tools for generating documentation.

* **Version control**: 

  This section provides information about using the GIT version control system
  for managing and publishing the documentation. 
  It includes guidelines for organizing documentation files, committing changes, and collaborating with other contributors.
